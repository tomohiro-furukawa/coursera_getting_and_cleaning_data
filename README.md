# Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" class - peer assessment

This repo is for "Getting and Cleaning Data" class peer assessment.

## How the script works

run_analysis.R contains a function run_analysis() which reads the original data set and returns tidy data.
The detailed steps in this function are as follows:
1. merges data set to create one data set
2. extracts means and standard deviations
3. replace with descriptive activity names
4. labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. creates a second data set with average values for each activity/subject
