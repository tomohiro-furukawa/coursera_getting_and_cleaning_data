# Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" class - peer assessment

This repo is for "Getting and Cleaning Data" class peer assessment.

## How the script works

run_analysis.R contains a function run_analysis() which reads the original data set and returns tidy data.
The detailed steps in this function are as follows:
- merges data set to create one data set
- extracts means and standard deviations
- replace with descriptive activity names
- labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- creates a second data set with average values for each activity/subject
